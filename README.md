# go-whosonfirst-rasterzen

Go package for working with Who's On First files and go-rasterzen tiles.

## Install

You will need to have both `Go` (specifically a version of Go more recent than 1.6 so let's just assume you need [Go 1.8](https://golang.org/dl/) or higher) and the `make` programs installed on your computer. Assuming you do just type:

```
make bin
```

## Important

This does not work yet. No, really. This won't work until the `seed` branch of https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-rasterzen is merged in to master.
